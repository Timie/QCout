QCout
=====

This project aims to develop a lightweight macro/object which can be used the similar way as Qt's QDebug/qDebug() objects/macros, but instead of working upon standard error stream, the QCout will work upon standard output stream. The implementation will try to behave as similarly as possible to the behaviour of QDebug.
